# Cloud Database
I am using Google firebase and using their authentication database. 
It stores the users private information like emails and passwords. It also tracks whether the user is logged in or not.

# Development Environment

I used Expo and React Native to build the app. I also used within the react native, the react navigation and screen libraries. 
The code has been written in JavaScript on the visual studio code IDE

# Useful Websites

* [React Native Documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
* [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/)
* [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs?authuser=0)

# Future Work
* Integrate a profile page
* Add another database with groups and which users are in each group
* Connect this app with previous app to create a fully functional app
